    "#### 1. What’s the DC component in PPG?\n",
    "\n",
    "* PPG is made up of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **DC (slow-varying baseline):** due to tissue absorption, venous blood, skin, etc. Changes very slowly (seconds–minutes scale).\n",
    "  * **AC (pulsatile component):** due to arterial blood volume changes with each heartbeat (\\~1 Hz at 60 bpm). This is the part we want for HR and SpO₂.\n",
    "\n",
    "So “DC removal” = separating the **slow baseline** from the **fast pulsations**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Why `window = 250` (≈0.5s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sampling frequency `fs = 500 Hz` → 500 samples per second.\n",
    "* A `window = 250` samples corresponds to **0.5 seconds of signal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why 0.5s?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heartbeat is typically 0.6–1.0s (60–100 bpm).\n",
    "* By choosing a smoothing window smaller than a heartbeat (0.5s), the filter captures **slow variations (baseline drift)** without erasing the main pulsatile wave.\n",
    "* If the window were too large (say 2s), the baseline would follow the heartbeat too much → not true DC removal.\n",
    "* If too small (say 50 ms), it would eat into the AC component → distorting the peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Why Gaussian filter here?\n",
    "\n",
    "* `gaussian_filter1d` with `sigma=window` smooths the signal, giving a “local average” baseline.\n",
    "* Subtracting this smoothed signal removes low-frequency baseline wander, leaving pulsations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "* A rolling 0.5s baseline ≈ “average level of the signal around the current point.”\n",
    "* Subtracting it removes slow tissue absorption trends and motion drift, but keeps beat-to-beat pulsations intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short: 0.5s was chosen because it’s short enough not to wipe out the heartbeat waveform, but long enough to capture and remove the slow baseline drift.**\n",

    "#### 5. Why **order = 3** in `bandpass_filter`?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filter order** = steepness of the transition band (how fast it attenuates outside 0.75–5 Hz).\n",
    "* Higher order = steeper cutoff but also:\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 6. Why **filtfilt**?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normal filtering (e.g., `lfilter`) introduces **phase shift** (waveform is shifted in time). That’s a disaster if you’re detecting peaks (systolic/diastolic).\n",
    "* **`filtfilt`** = forward + backward filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Runs the signal through the filter forward, then again backward.\n",

    "#### 7. Why consider only `pleth_1` and `pleth_2` for SpO2 estimation?\n",
    "\n",
    "SpO2 is estimated from a photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal by comparing the absorption of **red** and **infrared** light by the blood, as oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb these wavelengths differently. This comparison is used to calculate the ratio of AC (pulsatile) to DC (non-pulsatile) components of the PPG signal from both light wavelengths, which is then used in an empirical equation to determine the SpO2 level.\n",

    "    **Q. Why 0.5s?**\n",

    "    It’s based on physiological constraints:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Normal human heart rate is 60–100 bpm → each beat is 0.6–1.0 seconds apart.\n",

    "  A physiologic diastolic peak usually appears about **0.1–0.4 seconds after the notch** (roughly 20–40% of the RR interval). For a candidate to be accepted, it’s sensible to require it to be **at least ~10–15% of the RR before the next systolic peak**.\n",
